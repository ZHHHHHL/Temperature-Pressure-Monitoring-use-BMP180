# Temperature & Pressure Monitoring Project

## Overview

This project involves the creation of a monitoring system using an Arduino board to track temperature and pressure, displaying the data on seven-segment displays. The BMP180 sensor, combined with an appropriate library, ensures accurate and swift data presentation. This document discusses the programming and circuit design, emphasizing careful sensor and circuit choices, and includes a thorough demonstration confirming the system's effectiveness in real-time temperature and pressure monitoring.

## Program Code

```cpp
#include <Wire.h>
#include <Adafruit_BMP085.h>
#include "SevSeg.h"

Adafruit_BMP085 bmp;
SevSeg sevseg; // Initialize library objects

byte numDigits = 6; // Number of digits on the display
byte digitPins[] = {2, 3, 4, 5}; // Common anode pins
byte segmentPins[] = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}; // Segment pins
bool resistorsOnSegments = false;
byte hardwareConfig = COMMON_ANODE;
bool updateWithDelays = false;
bool leadingZeros = false;
bool disableDecPoint = false;
int i;
volatile bool enterInterrupt = false;

void setup() {
  sevseg.begin(hardwareConfig, numDigits, digitPins, segmentPins, resistorsOnSegments, updateWithDelays, leadingZeros, disableDecPoint);
  sevseg.setBrightness(6);
  if (!bmp.begin()) {
    while (1) {}
  }
}

void loop() {
  if (bmp.readTemperature() >= 50 && bmp.readPressure() >= 105000) {
    enterInterrupt = true;
  } else {
    enterInterrupt = false;
  }

  if (!enterInterrupt) {
    i = bmp.readTemperature();
    i = i * 100;
    sevseg.setNumber(i);
    for (int k = 0; k < 32000; k++) {
      sevseg.refreshDisplay();
    }
    sevseg.setNumber(bmp.readPressure());
    for (int k = 0; k < 32000; k++) {
      sevseg.refreshDisplay();
    }
  }

  if (enterInterrupt) {
    sevseg.setNumber(5000, 2);
    for (int k = 0; k < 32000; k++) {
      sevseg.refreshDisplay();
    }
    sevseg.setNumber(105000, 2);
    for (int k = 0; k < 32000; k++) {
      sevseg.refreshDisplay();
    }
    if (bmp.readTemperature() < 50 || bmp.readPressure() < 105000) {
      enterInterrupt = false;
    }
  }
}

## Circuit Design & Simulation with Proteus

To connect a 4-bit 7-segment display to the Arduino for output, we have opted for an integrated temperature and pressure sensor. This sensor simplifies the setup, requiring only two interfaces and a power supply. Utilizing a compatible library with Arduino, we can effortlessly obtain accurate temperature and pressure readings.

Through the connection of code and simulated circuitry, the device consistently displays temperature and atmospheric pressure at regular intervals. Adjusting the temperature and pressure by manipulating the button on the BMP180 sensor results in real-time updates on the seven-segment display. When both temperature and pressure surpass the predetermined thresholds, the display alternates to showcase the set threshold temperature and pressure, with the decimal point on the last digit illuminating momentarily for clarity.

## Problems and Solutions

Several issues arose during the process:

1. **Incompatibility Between SevSeg Library and Delay Function**: The SevSeg library cannot be used with the `delay` function. As an alternative, countdowns using `int i` were employed, relying on the code execution time as a form of delay.

2. **Persistence of Vision Effect in Simulation**: The 4-digit seven-segment display rapidly blinks each digit in sequence. In Proteus, this effect cannot be replicated accurately. System delays and adjustments to the trigger time of the seven-segment display were necessary to achieve accurate representation.

## Conclusion

This project aimed to design an Arduino-based temperature and pressure monitoring system with real-time data displayed on a 4-bit 7-segment display. To simplify the code, the SevSeg library was used, allowing for easy data display. However, this introduced an issue with the incompatibility between the SevSeg library and the delay function. A workaround was implemented by simulating delays within the code runtime.

The key component of the system was the BMP180 sensor, which required only two interfaces and a power supply to obtain temperature and pressure data. System delays and adjustments to the trigger time of the seven-segment display were introduced for accurate representation of the blinking effect in Proteus. By integrating these techniques, a robust monitoring system was successfully established, displaying real-time temperature and pressure. When predefined thresholds were reached, the system responded rapidly, refreshing the display to alert the user.
